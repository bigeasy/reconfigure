Generate the `bytes.txt`. The `watch` program will watch the current directory
do you can copy `bytes.txt` to new files in this directory and see the events
and `stat`s to determine the behavior on different operating systems. It is
actually interesting to watch the `bytes.txt` file get generated.

Please do not commit the `bytes.txt` to `git`. I added `*.txt` for this
directory to `.gitignore`, so you can use `*.txt` as a suffix when you copy the
bytes around.
